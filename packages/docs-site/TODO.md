# Todo

- change the website main image to a non fintech one
- add to readme for github and npm
- add a build setting to a unique name for images for use it on github

- add all example to help understand data binding and add links from help page
- create some component library, for example MUI on web
- create an api communication library under http protocol
- create some application examples to see what the solution is capable of.

## api react

- Predefined components
- Predefined functions
- redux mechanism

## api json

- Data structure
- multiple stores
- path
- path modifier
- data listener on multiple place
- jsonata in set or in get
- few layout example with view and grid def
- This little technique can change the relative path nestedly as well.
