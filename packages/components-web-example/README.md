# JSONUI component example

This is a component example for JsonUI, please check the usage in [jsonui.org](https://jsonui.org)

This is a Json markup language to define User Interface as a canvas where you can draw with Json definition.

When you change the Json definition, the interface immediately reflects on what you defined/changed.

This is just an example of how you can define custom components and use it in jsonui.

Enjoy
