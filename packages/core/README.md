# JSONUI

This is a core module of JsonUI, please use check the usage in @jsonui/react or @jsonui/reactnative

This is a Json markup language to define User Interface as a canvas where you can draw with Json definition.

When you change the Json definition, the interface immediately reflects on what you defined/changed.

Actually JSONUI is available for **react** and **react-native**. It will be able to integrate to 99% of the cross-platform environments, thanks for reactjs ecosystem

The UI definition contains a layout definition and components configuration as well. The most important it has a built in **state management system**. Data can be **persistent** or not, depends on the name of the store.

## Core concept

Build a data driven UI. The "definition" is changeable by developer anytime and any reason.
If you would like to build a remote controlled app or a form generator app, I hope you will love it.
